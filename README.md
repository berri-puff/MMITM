- **ESLint and Prettier**: For code consistency and formatting
- **@react-google-maps/api**: To integrate Google Maps for location services
- **Google Places API**: Used for identifying potential venues based on user locations. It offers a comprehensive database of venues, enabling the app to suggest a selection of suitable meeting spots.
